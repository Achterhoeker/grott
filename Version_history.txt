#Done in 1.0.4
#       Clean up coding 
#       Test with real data 
#       implemetd mqtt 
#       implemented scrambled vs nonscrambled (needs to be tested in with old inverter)
#       Growatt old wifi release support (needs to be tested with old inverter)           
#       Read config file and commandline parms 
#       Verbose vs non verbose 
#       Enable running as a services and automatic startup after reboot 
#       Code review by peer
#       Added in github: https://github.com/johanmeijer/grott
#       Document and add service example to git
#
#Done   in 1.0.5
#V      Changed some verbose print output to trace ouput to keep verbose messages clean and lean 
#V      Add more relevant values to JSON message
#V      Make print data unbufferd to see messages direct in journal when running as as service (python -u parm added in grott.service )
#V      MQTT error handling improved
#V      Process and sent values only if PVstatus is 0 or 1. Detected unexpected values while pvstatus was 257. This an quick fix. Has to look for realroot cause reason (probably not a monitor record) 
#V      included messages for problem detection / solving of unexpected PVSTATUS = 257 issue
#
#Done   in 1.0.6
#       Resolved problem with specifing offset in .ini. Change in record by growatt (Since 23 March 2020) now need a offset of 26! 
#       Specify valueoffset = 26 and compat = True in ini file!
#Done   in 1.0.7
#       Resolved problem with unecrypted records
#       added authentication (user / password) for MQTT, specify in MQTT section of ini auth = False (default ) or True and user = "xxxxxxx" (grott : default) password = "xxxxx" (default : growatt2020)
#Done   in 1.0.8
#       Really solved problem with unecrypted records
#Done   in 1.0.9 
#       Fix json message for pv1watt, add pv1voltage, pv2voltage, pv1current, pv2current, pvtemp;
#Done   in 1.1.0 
#       added pvipmtemperature to the json message (not used in 1500s)
#Done   in 1.1.1 
#       Only test version no real changes 
#Done   in 1.1.2 
#       Change MQTT publish.single keepalive =60 (default), this seem to solve disconnect error (client was always connected, is not the intention with publish.single)
#Done   in 2.0.0
#       Enable proxy functionality 
#       Streamline code
